This is a basic javascript and html interpreter i.e in simple terms a web browser which I am making for my miniproject in Compiler Design at University. Let's see how far I can take it once this semester is done ;)
Also this is part of my Udacity Building a Web Browser course, so its always nice to have a repo for that.
Contributions to the code are more than welcome.
